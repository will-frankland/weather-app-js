## Project Description

A vanilla Javascript app designed to display the weather data for the location of the user using latitude & longitude data to pinpoint location.

The app will display:
- Current city
- A weather icon
- Temperature (which can be click to toggle Farenheit or Celsius)
- Feels like temperature
- Description of current weather

I used openweathermap.org API to pull weather data including the icons for this mini-project.


## Tech Stack
